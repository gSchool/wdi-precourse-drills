        <p>My career goal is to specialize in front end web development. I actually started in graphic design and slowly gravitated towards
            the more digital side over the years. </p>
        
        <p>
            Recently I've been learning CSS pre-processors like SASS & Bourbon/Neat.
            <br> I would really like to learn more about React/PHP and data visualization libraries similar to D3 and Vue.js.
            It would also be really cool to work in the "sports world" with web dev in any kind of way but am open to anything! üëç </p>
