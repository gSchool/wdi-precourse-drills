        <p> I always wondered how people could keep things organized, both in their brain and on a screen, when building a website. It looks like I'm about to find out the hard way. The hard way is pretty exciting, however. </p>

        <p>I've bounced around "careers" like a little metal ball in one of those machines that yells TILT when you get too excited playing it. Battery pack builder. Skateboard filmer. Event decorist. Motion graphics creator. Bar backer. Magazine editor. Lawn mower. College goer. There are many who can say the same. It's tough to focus and progress in a certain area when you're always wanting to learn/experience something new. </p>

        <p>Seems to me like there's lots to learn and experience. Lots of avenues and alleys, thoroughfares and freeways. Lots of difficulties and frustrations, accomplishments and satisfaction. Maybe even a couple of lols. And that's what I want. There might even be some money to be had.</p>
