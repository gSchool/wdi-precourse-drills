				<p>I assist Drs. Kelley Crews and Thoralf Meyer with their NSF-funded research on landscape ecology and land-use/land-cover change in the Okavango Delta. This summer I will be travelling with UT's Spatial Sciences Lab to Maun, Botswana to assist with multiple research campaigns and to work on my own independent research about elephant activity in riparian woodland habitats! I also assist Dr. Caroline Faria with her NSF-funded research on globalization and Dubai's hair and beauty industries. My responsibilities as a research assistant include land-cover change analyses on ecologically sensitive areas, digital cartography, literature review, organizing research symposiums, writing calls for papers, data analysis, and more.</p>
