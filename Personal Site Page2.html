      I have a few friends that are in the coding and web development field, and one friend mentioned that I should look into a coding immersive program. After doing some research, I found Galvanize and began taking some of the free Learn to Code classes they offered. I soon realized how fun and challenging coding was for me, and I applied to Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program. I have now been accepted into the g84 cohort in Denver, and I am looking forward to how this program will help me change career paths.

      As of now, I do not have a specific job in mind that I would like to have after I complete the immersive course. I am open to all of the different opportunities that Galvanize can prepare me for, and will try to decide once I have a better idea of what area of coding I enjoy the most as I progress through the course. I am excited to see where I will be in about six months from now!
