    <h1>James Mendenhall</h1>

    <p>I am extremely excited to start the 24 week full stack developer program at Galvanize. As you can probably see, I am a beginner with a lot to learn about web development. The end game is to find employment with a startup, or even a larger company
      with a laid-back culture. Although a 24 week web development program is daunting, I look forward to the challenge!
