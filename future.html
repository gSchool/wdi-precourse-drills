  		<h1>My Future</h1>

		<br>
  		<br>
  		<p>
  			As far as my future, the door is open.  I have aspirations to one day own my own business.  I have created business plans or rough plans in my head for many great business ideas.  The one thing that alwas seemed to get in my way was technology.  
  		<br>
  		<br>
  			I know what you are thinking...and yes, technology should be my best friend when starting a business in 2017.  So, let me rephrase.  My lack of programming knowledge was what was getting in my way.  That is where programming comes into play and it comes in two stages.
  		</p>

  		
  		<section class="col-1-2"> <!--I somehow lost my columns.  I put in the slideToggle and the columns were there.  I cleaned up some code that was no longer needed and now the columns won't sit right on the page.-->

  			<h2>Experience</h2>
  			<br>
  			<br>
  			<p>
  				Galvanize is just the start of my programming experience.  It will allow me to gain the knowledge I need in order to get a career in programming.  Not only did I choose Galvanize for its top technology education, but for its connections as well.  The thought of being able to network with many companies in the area to strengthen my opportunities for a career in programming is amazing!  Not only that, but my heart always gravitates toward smaller companies and startups since I have an entrepreneurial mindset myself.  Being able to connect with all types of companies is an added bonus!
  			<br>
  			<br>
  				My current hopes are to start a career with a smaller company and work hard to become a senior developer.  With a good income and growing knowledge of programming, maybe then I can work on some of the business ideas I have had for so long.  This leads us to the second stage...

			<h2>Personal Growth</h2>			
			<br>
  			<br>
  			<p>
  				My father has had some odd jobs in his life, but as he grew, he became his own boss successfully running a commercial photography company and a mold remediation company.  He always taught me that there would always be the opportunity to work for myself and taught me the power of entrepreneurship.
  			<br>
  			<br>
  				I already talked about my passion for owning my own business.  On top of that passion, I ran my own private lacrosse coaching company for a few summers in college.  I would like to reboot that business but with a tech twist.  The idea is to have a coaching web application that private coaches can use in order to keep track of their business.
  			<br>
  			<br>
  				They can keep track of:

  			<ul>
  				<li>-Their Clients</li>
  				<li>-Their Clients' Goals, Strengths and Weaknesses</li>
  				<li>-Drills to Achieve Those Goals (With Video)</li>
  				<li>-A Shared Calendar</li>
  				<li>-Much More...</li>
  			</ul>

  			<br>
  			<br>
  				This is just one of the many ideas that I have had where programming could greatly benfit the business plan.
