  <p> I am extremely excited
     about my journey soon to take place at Galvanize. To some, mananging successful resturant/
     bowling alley/movie theater, while bartending would be a challange, but for myself day I find
     it very boring and unchallanging. I feel my time there has run its
     course and I long for something that challanges my intellect and problem solving skills. </p>
     <p>I have a pretty clear view on how difficult the task ahead of me are, and know alot of work and dedication
        will be needed to pull through these coming months. That being said, I and eager so show my skills and tenacity
        in working towards completing this course and landing a job in the industry that rewards me for my talents,
        hardwork and dedication while providing a better life style for myself and my family.</p>
     <p>At this time I do not have a specific company I wish to work for. Even if there was a company I am interested in
        with open positions they will most likly be filled by the time I have completed Galvanize. For now, my main focus
        is to develop my skills in both coding and problem solving to better facilitate my employability in the coming
        months.
