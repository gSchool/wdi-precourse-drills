    <div id="aboutMeContent">
      <p id="aboutMeContentP1">Hi, my name is Chelsea. I am a proud Florida State University alumnus (GO NOLES!) with a Bachelor’s degree in Visual Disabilities Studies and a Master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction. I was born in Virginia Beach, Virginia, but spent the majority of my life growing up in Tampa, Florida.</p>

      <p id="aboutMeContentP2">I currently work as a Certified Teacher of the Visually Impaired (CTVI) and a Certified Orientation and Mobility Specialist (COMS). In simpler terms, I work with students who are visually impaired by teaching them how to read and write braille, use their cane, etc... There are many other skills and techniques that we work on together, but ultimately, the end goal is to teach my students the skills necessary to be a functioning, independent adult.</p>
