        <h4>Pre-Galvanize</h4>
        <p>I am eager to start Galvanizeâ€™s web development immersive course this summer! I decided to steer my career down a different path in order to learn and become competent in new and useful skills. I know that, to many people, this career switch sounds completely unrelated to my current line of work, however, software development and the visual impairment community go hand-in-hand.</p>

        <h4>Tech & Vision: How do they relate?</h4>
        <p>Many people with visual impairments rely heavily on their technology in order to access their world. In fact, many people who are visually impaired have some sort of tech tool that they use everyday, such as iPhone, Android, iPad, Braille Notetaker, closed circuit TV (CCTV), screen reader software, laptop computers, etc. Technology plays an imperative role in the lives of individuals with visual impairments. Accessibility is the key component for this population to be independent.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="whatsNextContentP3">
        <h4>Looking forward</h4>
        <p>I aspire to work for a company that creates these web tools and applications for individuals who are visually impaired and, perhaps, for individuals with additional disabilities. I am confident that technology will only continue to advance and increase the independence of these populations.</p>
