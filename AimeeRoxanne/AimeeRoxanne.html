    <h1>My name is Aimee Roxanne.
  </h1>
    <p>Born and raised in CO, I grew up in the burbs of Boco. I was a jock for the first half of my life but that feels VERY foreign to me now. These days I much prefer sitting still and entertainment like puzzles and podcasts.

    <h1>Denver > Boulder
  </h1>
    <p>I’ve lived in Denver for the last 10 years. Until recently, I was totally that girl who said “Ugh I could never live in Boulder again,” with authentic disdain. Things change though, and Denver has too. I’ve been back in Boco for about 6 months and I have to say, I really dig how quiet it is here. I also don’t hate getting to see the stars on a regular basis and not feeling like I’m going to die every time I get on my bike.

  <p>T&A is a boutique creative studio that specializes in branding and content strategy for startups. We offer branding, web development, content creation and social media management. We’ve been in business for a little over a year and continue to grow. My other half Tori is incredible and is holding down the fort while I become a web developer so we can continue our efforts in taking over the world.
