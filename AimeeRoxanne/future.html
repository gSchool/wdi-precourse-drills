    <h1>I want to be a web developer…
  </h1>
    <p>I have been dancing around this immersive for several years now, and am super stoked to finally be officially enrolled. I’ve worked alongside developers in several positions, and have always found myself more interest in their work than mine. I hope to stay self employed after graduating, and continue to create the job that will allow me the quality of life I want.

    <h1>I want to travel…
  </h1>
    <p>I borrowed a lot of money in college to travel, and that was great. Ever since I’ve been paying it off and haven’t had the chance to leave the country in the last 6 years. Japan + Korea are next on my list for a whole slew of reasons, one being a tattoo artist that I hope to get some work from named <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/woo_loves_you/?hl=en">Woo</a>.

  <h1>I want to go back to school again…
</h1>
  <p>I have always seen myself as a teacher. One of my biggest gripes about society is the lack of access and conversation around human sexuality. If and when I do go back to school, it will likely be for some time of sex education or therapy. I see myself merging all my areas of passion in some way that will help people on a larger scale what I'm currently capable of.
