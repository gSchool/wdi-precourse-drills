        <h3><p>I am very much interested in learning about both web development and data science. Upon completion of this program, I would love to work at a large company that will allow me to enhance my skills as a developer. I know that the field of machine learning and AI is moving forward very fast. There is so much to learn and I don't think that a class is really a place where you can learn 'everything' you need to in order to become active in the field. What I hope to do is to be able to work hard in the WDI class to learn the foundations of being a developer and then become more involved in the field through 'life time learning' is the years ahead.
