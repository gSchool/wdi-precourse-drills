    <h3>(cont.)</h3>
      <p>I am extremely excited to start the Galvanize web development program. I have just recently gotten into technology and programming, but from what I have learned it has been so much fun! I am unsure of where I will go after the program, but I am hoping I will become a full stack developer for a large company. Otherwise, maybe I will do my own business, but who knows as of right now.</p>
      <p>I am very into being creative and coming up with ideas, but I am also a "control freak" so back end development would be very interesting as well; which is why I think a full stack developer would be a good route for me to take.
