    <p>Im 21 years old, the second of four children, and was born and raised in Colorado Springs. I have my Bachelors degree in Biology, and for most of my life focused on medicine. My favorite color is blue and my favorite food is pretty much all foods.</p>
    <p>My personality is very outgoing and friendly. I love to try new things no matter how crazy it may seem. I do not have social media (yes I know surprising), but I just find it to be useless for my personal life.</p>
