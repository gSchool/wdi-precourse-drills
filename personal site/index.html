      <p>
        I'm a born-and-raised Washingtonian who has lived all over the state. I grew up building forts in Granite Falls, attended high school at Lakeside in Seattle, went east of the mountains to attend Whitman College in Walla Walla, moved back to the west side to the wet forests of Issaquah, and now reside in bustling Ballard, the land of breweries.

      <h1 class="text-center">my FAMILY</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a CODA, which is a Child of Deaf Adults, and fluent in American Sign Language. My mom is Puerto Rican, and started dating my dad (mostly Danish) while they were performing in their high school's production of West Side Story as Tony and Maria.
        <br><br>
        I have two older sisters, and we're all creative and <i>very</i> into our hobbies. My two energetic nieces are smart and entertaining, and I love watching them grow up.
        <br><br>
        Last year, I married my wife Kate at the most fun wedding I've ever been to. We went to Iceland for our honeymoon, which involved orienteering, playing games, and poking around the landscape, which describes how we spend our time in Washington just as well.

      <h1 class="text-center">how I PLAY</h1>
      <p>
        My main outdoor activity is orienteering, which is a sport for map and compass. You get a super detailed map with checkpoints, and you go find them (usually in a specific order) as fast as you can (or want). I love engaging my brain, getting physical and dirty, being outdoors, the friendly community, and the opportunity to venture off-trail to sneak up on all sorts of beautiful and interesting things.
        <br><br>
        Indoors, I love to play board games, which is maybe an understatement. Like orienteering, it engages my brain with playful but interesting choices. I consume games like books, as if the mechanisms of each were stories to unfold. In addition to playing, I also love the challenge of choosing 'just the right game' for a person or situation. Like micro beers in Seattle, the quality and variety of games has exploded, providing endless options.
        <br><br>
        As a former bike racer (road, cyclocross, mountain, track, Xterra, adventure, mtb-orienteering...), I also like to ride bikes, though I mostly just commute now, and tour once in a while.

      <h1 class="text-center">places I've TRAVELed</h1>
      <p>
        I haven't racked up many countries (Canada, Puerto Rico, Hungary, Iceland), but I've seen a lot of the United States. In the summer of 2009, my best friend from college and I rode our bicycles, self-supported, from Oregon to Virgina on the TransAmerica bike route. It took almost 3 months to ride over 4,200 miles. It's hard to sum up the experience, but I did make a <a href="https://vimeo.com/7223704">fairly entertaining video</a> that tries.

      <h1 class="text-center">the WORK I've done</h1>
      <p>
        I'm grateful that my school and work has often involved my interests. In college, I majored in Studio Art (I made the graphics for this page!), and unofficially, bike racing. After gradutation, I coached a junior cycling team, taught bike repair, and later worked in a bike shop. I then got into marketing for a small company that puts on trail running and navigation events. This gave me the opportunity to direct a major rebranding, which is what exposed me to web design. We had hired a developer, and I kept wanting to do his job, so I thought, "well, why not do his job?"
        <br><br>
        So I researched what kind of web-related roles I might like, and settled on UX Design. I took an online course, redesigned and built my <a href="http://cascadeoc.org/">local orienteering club web page</a> as an ambitious project, and landed a job as a UX Designer with a local startup, <a href="https://motion.social/">motion.social</a>. Motion.social is all about connecting people through social fitness, so even in tech, my interests continued to pertain to my work.

      <a name="goals"></a>
      <img src="images/goal.svg" alt="goal in American Sign Language">
      <h1 class="text-center">my GOALS</h1>
        <p>
          Now, of course, I'm here at Galvanize's web development program. While I enjoyed my time as a UX Designer, I learned that it wasn't close enough to the <i>building</i> process for me. From the little development I've done, I know that I find turning keystrokes and logic into something you can see and interact with to be totally rewarding. It's like... <i>a game</i>.
        <br><br>
          So, what are my goals? Well, in addition to orienteering more abroad, cycling more touring routes, and opening a board game pub someday...
        <br><br>
          I think I'd like to be the web dev unicorn, who can UX, design, and <b>BUILD</b>. Or, maybe my idea of what kind of development I want to do will change over the course of the program. There's a lot out there that I've yet to learn about. Ultimately, I know that I'm cut out to be a MAKER, and I'm here to learn how to MAKE cool things.
