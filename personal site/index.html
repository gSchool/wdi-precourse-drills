  <h1>Brian Novak</h1>

  <p> Hello g70WD cohort-mates (and instructors)! My name is Brian and I'm super
    excited to meet you all and work together over the next six months (or more)!
    I grew up in a small farming town in western Illinois, but have lived in Denver for
    the last twelve years.  Though I love the mountains, I'm not much of a skier - I have
    no proficiency on the powder.  I do enjoy a good visit to Blackhawk though. $$$
