  <h1>Brian Novak, Continued</h1>

  <p>Let me tell you a little about why I am now completing the Galvanize
    program after a fifteen-year hiatus from technology. My undergraduate work was
    in Computer Science, but my first job after graduating left me with more than a
    jaded view on the industry. I went back to school and earned my master's
    degree in a program called College Student Personnel, otherwise known as
    Higher Education Administration.
  </p>

  <p>I worked in education, mainly at colleges and universities, helping students
    develop their leadership skills and realize their potential through co-curricular
    activities and specialized trainings. After a while, this grew stale (for a number
    of reasons) and I left to pursue other interests.  I have taken to calling this time
    my "gap year."  It was pretty awesome, but mainly because I worked for United Airlines
    and was able to travel the world with much more ease.
  </p>

  <p>I've always remained interested in technology, staying up-to-date with new gadgets
    and current on popular trends. I'm hopeful that after Galvanize I will find work
    with a Denver-based startup company that focuses on some kind of integration with
    new technologies.  I mean, who doesn't want to be a real-life Tony Stark? :)
