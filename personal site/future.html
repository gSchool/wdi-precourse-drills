      <h1>Career Goals</h1>
      <p>I'm excited to start Galvanize and become a web developer. My background is in electrical engineering which is where I had the opportunity to dip my toe into computer programming. Turns out I really love to code so I'm eager to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
