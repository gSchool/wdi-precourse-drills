    <p>I would like to work in digital strategy for a biotechnology company. In college,
      I studied biochemistry and a minor in entrepreneurship.
      I started working in cell culture cancer research lab. Once I graduated,
       I moved to Colorado to work for Bio-Techne, a biological research reagent company.
      For the first year there I worked with their supply network. This involved yearly
      margin negotations and data integrity management of the supplier's product line.</p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of a calculator made with jquery.</br>
      <div>
        <button class="jsEx">press this work in progress</button>
      </div>
      <script>
      $( ".jsEx" ).click(function() {
        alert( "This is work in progress." );
      });
      </script>
      The gif below is a representation of how I feel about learning more:</br>
