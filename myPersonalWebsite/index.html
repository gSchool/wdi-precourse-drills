      <div class="two-thirds fRight frame2" ><p>I live in Longmont with my long time girlfriend, Katie and two dogs, Stella and Wiley.
        Our house is small just like our family, but we live and love larger than life!
        I never thought about web development as a new career path, but the seed was planted and now two years later I have officially
        started my journey as a web developer. This a fun and exciting field where I only have a fundamental
        grasp of concepts, language, and the industry itself.
        <br>Metalsmithing will always be my passion, but I do like to play with other things.<br>
        I love the summer time. There is nothing better than living in shorts and sandals. <br>
        When I'm not in my back yard gardening, or taking our dogs to the reservoir, heading up to the Arkansas River and fishing the headwaters is the next best thing. <br>
        Oh and zombies, I <span class="creepy1 ">love </span>zombies.</p></div>

       <div class="one-quarter fLeft frame2" style="margin-left: 35px"><p>I graduated from Colorado State University in 2004 with a B.F.A. in metalsmithing.
         Since graduating, I became a jeweler and have been working in custom jewelry shops for the past twelve years.
         I decided to change career paths because the outlook on my retirement was not too bright.
         When Katie's sister Erin suggested web development I initially balked at the idea..... "Me writing code for the internets?"
         As I looked into the possibility I discovered that this was not only a plausible avenue,
         but the demand for developers appears to be like the new manufacturing industry of the twenty first century.
         I honestly do not know where my career will take me.
         I do know that my future self will be happy I walked this path.
