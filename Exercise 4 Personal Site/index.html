			<p>Hi, I'm Steve. I'm from the coast of South Carolina and just moved to Denver. I like to spend my weekends out in the wilderness participating in the activities each season of Colorado has to offer. Springs and summers are spent fly fishing and camping. While once snow falls you can find me on the slopes snowboarding. I have a 11 month old Australian Shephard puppy named Rocco who makes for an awesome adventure sidekick. While attending Galvanize I know I'll be too busy to keep him entertained so he'll be chilling with my parents for the next 6 months. Total bummer! But its the best for him! </p>

			<p>Professionally, I'm a Certified Scrum Master with a knack for managing the construction of digital products. I've been at it since leaving the Navy back in 2013. I've worked on a range of projects: ERP system implementation/upgrade, Zendesk installation, front end overhaul, and back end design. I approach each project with a goal of creating a solid Definition of Done that will better the business and the lives it affects. Always looking for a good challenge and a chance to learn. I also take myself very seriously.</p>
