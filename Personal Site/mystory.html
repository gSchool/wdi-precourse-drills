  <h2>Who is Cole?</h2>

    <p>Hello there! My name's Cole Carroll and I'll be attending the Galvanize Web Developer program
      at the Platte Campus. When I'm not learning how to code, I enjoy working out, going out, reading, golf, longboarding, and playing
      with my two dogs, Pig and Jennings.</p>
      <img class="banner" src="images/banner.jpg" alt="me">
      <p>Besides programming, I have a huge interest in clinical psychology, in fact that's probably what
      I would be doing if for some reason I wasn't able to learn to be a web developer.</p>

      <p>I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I lived there through high school. I attending my undergraduate at Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO (go Skyhawks!),
        and from there I moved to Tempe, Arizona for a few years and then migrated to Denver. That was about eight years. Sheesh! Time flies.</p>

      <p>I'm so excited to start this new chapter in my life.</p>
