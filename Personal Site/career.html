I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled in the web development immersive because I've always been fascinated by the web's ability to bring people together. After Galvanize, I would love to work for a social network company like Snapchat or OKCupid.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>I spent the past 2 years and 9 months at a local Denver digital marketing business specializing in search engine optimization, this is where I learned to emphasis with developers, and figure out that it's what I want to go into. I'd rather fix the problems from the start. It's also where I got my start working with Javascript, creating several appliactions within the company.</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I graduated from CU Boulder in 2014, which seems pretty long ago now that I'm typing this out.</p>
