    <p>A winding path has led me to my career in web development. Coming from an artistic background has helped me see the power of creativity in action. I am so excited to further my education at Galvanize! After completing the web development immersive, I would love to find work involved with the outdoors. The forest service, national parks, or any number of hiking apps would be dream jobs for me.</p>
