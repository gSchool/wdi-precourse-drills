		<h1>THE FUTURE</h1>
		<p>I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to participate in the Web Development Immersive at Galvanize! I'm excited at the propect of having a career that is engaging, challenging, and rewarding. After the program, I hope to find a job in Denver and move there shortly thereafter.</p>

		<h2>INTERESTS IN THE FIELD</h2>
		<p>I like the idea of working on technology and software that helps to protect the privacy of those using it. It's important to help prevent the brand of far-reaching mass surveillance seen used by modern-day governments and corporations. I also find cryptocurrency very interesting and would like to work to further integrate it into our society.</p>
