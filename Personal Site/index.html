        <img src='tempe.jpg'>
        <p class='text'>I grew up here in the valley. I was born at St. Luke's hospital in Tempe, AZ and have lived in Tempe and the surrounding cities since.
          After high school, I attended Arizona State University for a few years before transferring to Univeristy of Phoenix where I graduated
          with a Bachelor's of Science in Management. For about 5 years, I worked in the insurance industry in a variety of roles. Recently I made
          the decision that I would like to pursue a career in web development and so I left the company and am now beginning my new path here at
          Galvanize!

      <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <div class = 'container'>
          <img src='hobbies.jpg'>
        <p class='text'>In my free time I try to find balance between getting out and staying active, and binge-watching seasons of The Office on Netflix. I
          enjoy going to the gym to workout and when the weather is nice, I like to go hiking. My favorite hike is Flat Iron at Superstition Mountains.
          When binge watching Netflix, some of my favorite shows include: New Girl, The Office, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and Parks and Recreation.</p>
        </div>
      <h4>Family</h4>
        <div class = 'container'>
          <img src ='family.jpg'>
        <p class='text'>My family consists of me and my wife, Caitlan, along with our two dogs. We have an Australian Shepherd named Aslan, and a Corgi mix named
          Aspen. I also have my parents and siblings who live in the area as well. My sister and her husband live in Tempe, down the street from me,
          and my brother lives in Mesa.</p>
        </div>
      <h4>Friends</h4>
        <div class = 'container'>
          <img src='friends.jpg'>
        <p class = 'text'>Part of what I enjoy doing to stay active, are Obstacle Runs. My favorite ones are the Spartan courses, but my friends and I have completed
          many others including the Tough Mudder, the Rugged Maniac, and more!</p>
