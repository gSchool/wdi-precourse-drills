<ul><em>Travel, pizza, coffee about sums it up.</em> </ul>
  <ul>My girlfriend and I are avid travelers and are always looking to book the next trip.</ul>
<ul>If we are not traveling then we are probably searching for the next best pizza place in Austin. Fun fact, the first website I ever created was entirely dedicated to the best Pizza Places in Austin.</ul>
<ul>I'm also a passionate coffee drinker. While living in Rome I became fascinated with the culture of drinking coffee and brought that love back with me to Texas.</ul>
