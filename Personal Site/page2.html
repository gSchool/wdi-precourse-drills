    <h1><center>My Plan </center></h1>

    <p>
      My plan is to immerse myself in Galvanize and to discover <br>
      aspects of coding that I'd like to specialize in. After <br>
      Galvanize, I'd like to find a job where I can use the coding <br>
      technologies that I'm most comfortable and confident in towards <br>
      a mission that I'm passionate about. The following animations <br>
      basically sum up how I feel at the moment:
    </p>
    <img src = "newAssets/images/wheelie.gif" alt = "mann"
                style = "width:350px;height:300px;">

    <img src = "newAssets/images/BB.gif" alt = "beavis"
                style = "width:350px;height:300px;">

<p>
  <button onclick="info();">Lets do this!</button>
      <script src="newAssets/js/personalScript.js" > </script>
</p>
</center>
  </body>
