		<h2>WHERE I'M FROM</h2>
		<p>I was born in Baltimore, MD, but at the age of 4 left all that behind to move to EL Dorado (a neighborhood in New Mexico). After just 2 years I left all that behind to live in Pleasanton, CA, until 3 years later whem I left all that behind to settle in Longmont, CO. I grew up in Boulder County and went to college at Fort Lewis in Durango, CO, where I got a degree in Philosophy.</p>

		<h2>WHAT I DO</h2>
		<p>During my time in the public school system I played Saxophone for 12 years, mostly in order to avoid doing any kind of real work. I do not play saxophone anymore. I have also dabbled in playing the piano, cello, clarinet, guitar, flute, and bass. In middle school I was in the Dungeons and Dragons club. Currently I spend most of my time sleeping, eating, running, reading, and studying for this program.</p>
