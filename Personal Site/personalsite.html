<h2><center>A Short Story: Chapter 1 </center></h2>
<h3><center>An Introduction</center></h3>

<p>My name is Paige and I grew up in Albuqueurque, New Mexico. I moved to Austin almost 6 years ago but before that I lived in Fort Worth, Boulder and Rome, Italy. I went to school at St. Edwards University and double majored in Art History and English Literature. Since graduation I have worked at a couple differnt start-ups across Austin. I started off at <a href = "https://favordelivery.com/Favor" target="_blank"> Favor </a> where I worked as a Content Quality Assistant and from there moved over to a company called <a href = "https://www.ownlocal.com/" target="_blank">OwnLocal</a>. At OwnLocal I worked as an Account Support Representative helping Newspapers digitalize their local ads in order to help create an online presence for small businesses. My most recent position was at <a href = "https://www.trendkite.com/" target="_blank">TrendKite</a> a PR Analytics company. Using boolean logic I built out searches for various companies that powered dashboards that could report on brands presence in the media.

  During my time at OwnLocal and TrendKite I fell in the love with the technology industry and came to realize that this was where I wanted to build my career!
