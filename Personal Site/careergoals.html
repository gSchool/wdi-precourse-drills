<P>
When I left college I had no clue what I wanted to do with my life. Luckily, I found my way into the tech industry where I fell in love with the products, companies and culture. Starting out in Customer Success allowed me to deep dive into the products and understand what customers interacted with on a daily basis. However with all technology there were always bugs to deal with and features to be added. I wanted to be able to fix the bugs and create the product but I didn't have the skill set to do so. Right when I was unsure of what path to take I found Galvanize!

<p>
I have a dream of becoming a Product Manager and I believe Galvanzie is the perfect place to begin that dream. While a degree in web development is not necessary for Product Mangement I think it is extremely important to understand the building blocks of what you hope to create. Galvanize will probably be one of the most difficult challenges I have taken on but I know that the skill set I will learn in the next six months will change my life.
