    <p>I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled in the web development 
    immersive because I think I will enjoy a technical career that will present the opportunity to continue to learn indefinitely. 
    After Galvanize, I would love to work in a full stack or front end development position utilizing React.</p>
