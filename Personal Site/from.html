    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p class = 'goalText'>With Galvanize I plan to familiarize myself with full stack web development and get a strong
      grasp on best practices when it comes to learning various different languages. I have always had a passion for
      working with computer programming and decided to take the leap and make a career change towards it.
      <br>
      <br>
      I'm open to pursuing various opportunities after completing this program, though considering I have an extensive
      insurance background, I feel as though I would fit well working with some of the insurance organizations that
      partner with Galvanize, especially USAA.</p>
