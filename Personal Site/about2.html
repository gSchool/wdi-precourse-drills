        <h1>Crossroads</h1>
          <p>Deciding to quit my job and join a bootcamp last year was a tough decision. I knew I was overdue for this life change and started doing research on the various coding bootcamps in town. Last November I was accepted into Denver University's coding boot camp but something didn't sit right with me. After going through the application and review process I had started to question whether I should hand over my deposit. This "immersive" course was only a 3 month program, which seemed extremely short compared to the other bootcamps I was researching. The curriculum seemed to be filled with buzzwords and I just didn't see myself getting a fully immersive experience within that time frame. Their shorter, part time course has their students learn ReactJS in a week, lol. Upon doing more research I found that the program was run by a third party company called Trilogy Education Services that partners with U.S. colleges so they could brand their service as a college institution, which was a red flag for me. With that on the table I frantically did more research and made it my mission to get accepted into Galvanize's Web Immersive cohort. Thankfully, I am here now...

        <h1>End Game</h1>
          <p>Upon completion of this web immersive program I hope to have acquired the skills to secure my first junior full stack job, preferably with a tech consulting company. I have the understanding that I may have to settle as either a junior front end or back end developer first which is okay. I'm not sure what my strengths will be yet, however, I'm hoping I can find a niche to specialize in down the road. Since I also enjoy management, my end game is to have the capability and knowledge to lead larger scale projects in the consulting world. Once I'm settled into a career, I wouldn't mind learning how to build iOS apps in my spare time, that seems fun.</p>
