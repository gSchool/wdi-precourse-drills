  <h2>Some thoughts about my future...</h2>
  <p>I want to bring a distinctly artistic approach to development. It is my goal to get to a level where my programs have a unique, thoughtful functionality with dope, fresh aesthetics. I would love find a job where I can exploit as much artistic freedom as possible. On the flip-side, I also want to make as much money as possible. Perhaps I can settle somewhere in the middle.</p>

  <p>I'm also interested in musical applications for code and development. I have thought up audio streaming programs to help listeners connect to their favorite DJ's via live-streaming audio. I'm also interested in developing tools for music producers and audio engineers. Effects plugins, digital synthesizers, and digital audio interfaces are all likely to be on my radar for side studies. However, there probably isn't much money in that. Most producers and musicians are broke and pirate the stuff anyways.
