  <h2>Where I come from.</h2>
  <p>I'm from Chicago via Indiana. Grew up in a small, backwards redneck town, but managed to escape to the relative culural hotbed of Indianapolis before Martinstucky USA could rub off on my personality too much. <br/> <br/> From there I went to Purdue to study Sociology. What a degree! I certainly recommend one if you want countless real-life applications and endless job opportunities. After graduation, I had my first foray into Colorado living, moving to Aspen to try out a year of the ski-bum life.  <br/> <br/> From there I moved to Chicago, where I spent many years working as a server, bartender, manager, and wine-director. For my final years in Chicago I split my time between restaurants and Stonecutter Recording Studios, where I worked as the in-house producer and assistant audio-engineer. While pay was scant, it was absolutely amazing to help struggling artists find and execute their vision, and I had the opportunity to make a couple tracks with Twista! </br> </br>
    Ultimately the mountains were calling me again, so I moved once more, and hopefully finally, to Colorado about a year ago. I found work at the Colorado Convention Center and Hyatt Regency setting up sound systems for large events - sounds exciting, but likely the worst job I've ever had. <br/> </br>
    It was after meeting and talking with a friend, a fellow musician-turned-coder, that I decided to re-dedicate myself to this new craft and carreer. I'm a little scared, but above all excited! I'm most excited about the proscpect of being able to create something from nothing. As a producer, I'm used to paying an arm-and-a-leg for the quality programs I need to make the good sounds. With development, everything you need to make something amazing is right there in your mind and at your fingertips!
