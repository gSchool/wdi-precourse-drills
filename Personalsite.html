      <p>I am a 27 year old man from Denver Colorado. I am not the most computer savy person, but I am very excited for this program, this is the first time I will be a full time student since High school.
        <p>I currently live with my brother Will, and my room mates Luke Romberg and Jake Robbins, who both recently completed this program.</p>
        <p>I have a cat named Bedhead. He was a dumpster kitten and is pretty weird.</P>
        <p>Pretty much every weekend you will find me somewhere in the backcountry, either riding my big ugly KLR 650, or backpacking, trail running, climbing, I like to stay active! </p>

        Also my instagram.</a>
      <p> Galvanize is the start of a journey to reshape my life and where I plan on going. Three of my very good friends have completed this program, and they have all suggested it to me. I am hoping to start a long, happy career, that gives me the means
        to persue my dreams and hobbies.</p>

      <p>I hope to find a career that keeps me challenged and interested, and which affords me the time to travel and train. My long term goal is to travel the world, as well as race, and hopefully survive / complete the Dakar Rally Malle Moto Devision.
        A very difficult 12-15 day race through the deserts of South America.</p>
