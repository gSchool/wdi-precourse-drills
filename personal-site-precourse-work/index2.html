      <p>
        As I discussed on my <a href="index.html" title="Just who is Curtis tho?">About Me</a> page, I've had a winding road to get to Galvanize and to my decision that I want to study web development and coding. I am beyond excited to start the program even tho I know it will be stressful and challenging at times. In the end I am confident it will have been well worth it. While I don't know exactly what I want to do career wise once I graduate, I expect that going through the program will show me more specifically what I like within the web development industry and then help guide my career choices. Will I like front end or server-side development more? What languages will be my favorite to work with? These are the questions I look forward to answering while learning at Galvanize!
      </p>

        One thing I do know, is once I graduate, my fiance and I want to move back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZjo3k_tdFc" target="_blank" title="Spokane can be hella charming...">Spokane</a> so I'll be looking for jobs over there once I complete the web development program. All we want in this life is to be able to afford a house and some land and we honestly don't foresee that being reasonable or possible if we stay in the Seattle area unfortunately. I really feel like the opporutunities that I'll have coming out of Galvanize are going to allow Stefan and I the chance to build the life we want to build together and that is #1 important to me. So really, the prospect of starting at Galvanize and being a developer has me feeling really
        good about where life is heading...
