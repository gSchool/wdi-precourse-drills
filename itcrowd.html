    <h1>Where To Next</h1>


      <p>Most people are starting their new journey at Galvanize with a college degree or two and lots of real world experience in their back pocket. I on the other hand, come to you with 6 years of stayin' home with kids and a GED I obtained in 2012. Getting into the Galvanize WDI should tell you a lot about who I am as a person.</p>

      <p>Where I am going is the fun part of my life. My goals are to become a pretty darn good programmer and web developer. I don't know much about what the tech field has to offer in terms of what kinds of things I want to work on. So for now I will just enjoy the learning process. I look forward to rediscovering who I am as a contributing individual. My husband and I would love to move our family to South Korea or New Zealand someday soon, so having these essential skills would make that a relatively easy adventure.</p>

      <p>The most important part of this new terrifying chapter of my life is that I will be able to show myself, my children, and others that it is more than possible to be whatever you want in life. I like to think that you should define yourself not by your experiences alone, but by how you use those experiences to propel yourself into the unknown.</p>
