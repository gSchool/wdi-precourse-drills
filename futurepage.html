  <h1> Peters future </h1>
  <h2>My future!</h2>
  <p>I have always enjoyed working on my computer and seeing what things I could do with it. 6 months ago, Alyssa and I began a 5 month trip exploring Europe and South East Asia. When
  we started to travel I decided I wanted some ideas I had about a future career to marinate inside my brain. While seeing other parts of the world and thinking about what I wanted my
future to be like, I decided coding was something I would enjoy and could do as a career. So here I am, starting my journey with Galvanize and my whole life! This GIF is just a small
represenation of how excited I am to be here!</p>

<h2>Let me <button id='show'>show</button> you my goals!</h2>
<div>Some goals I have throughout this course are to be able to develop a cool app, as well as develop my skills as a learner, student, and person!
I love logical thinking in everyday use, so coding really spoke to me. I am hoping to learn more about technology as a whole and to get specific skills to apply to technology and build cool things.
