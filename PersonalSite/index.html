<p class="detailedP"> Okay, so maybe the table wasnt the best idea. I was born in Portland, Oregon and lived there untill
I graduated from High School. After that I joined the Army and was stationed in Anchorage, Alaska and deployed to Afghanistan.
I met my husband about three years ago while I was living and working in Portland. We somehow managed a long distance relationship
for most of that time. I moved to Denver at the beginning of 2017.</p>
