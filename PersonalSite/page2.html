  <p class="detailedP">I wouldnt be honest if I didn't say that I was a little nervous about embarking on such
  a journey. Though I am incredibly excited at the same time. Where am I going in life? That
is the million dollar question. After I graduate from this course I would like to work in Denver for a few
years while increasing my skills and knowledge. My husband just started as the Executive Director for SAME Cafe
a food justice non-profit and has committed to a term of at least 3 years. After that we would both like to move
out of the country and live somewhere new for a few years. Which I hope with the combined skills I learn from this program
and the skills I will learn from working in an office for a few years, I will be able to work
remotely from anywhere. </p>
