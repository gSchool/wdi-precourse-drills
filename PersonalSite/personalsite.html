      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hello! My name is Kaitlin. I was born in California but have lived in Colorado since I was six. I have two older brothers and an older sister. This family photo is from my brother's wedding in Alaska last summer. <p>

      <p>There is nothing in the world I love more than dogs. Monkey is a four and a half pound yorkie poo. Indio is actually my brothers dog but I'm constantly trying to claim her as my own. She is a great outdoors dog and even carries her own pack when we go backpacking!<p>
