<h1>Sean Moudy</h1>

<p> My name is Sean Moudy. I grew up in Arkansas and experienced the 
    Department of Defense for about 15 years. I live in Denver with my wife (Holly)
    and two sons (Ellijah and James). We have two cats (Marley and Cringer). 
    Below is a set of pictures showing all six of us. I enjoy flyfishing, 
    skiing, research and development, and hiking.

<p>Please input a number between 1 and 10:</p>
<input id="numb">
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Submit</button>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction() {
    var x, text;

    // Get the value of the input field with id="numb"
    x = document.getElementById("numb").value;

    // If x is Not a Number or less than one or greater than 10
    if (isNaN(x) || x < 1 || x > 10) {
        text = "Input not valid, enter in a number between 1 and 10.";
    } else {
        text = "If I am ever tired or late for class it is the cats' fault for keeping me up all night.";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
}
