    <h2>Into the Future!</h2>

      I'm super excited about what I expect to be a life-changing experience with Galvanize, and even moreso about what the future holds for me after completion.  I'm very confident that I will be able to excel in the program since I've got a pretty decent background in software development in general, and learning the future of web technologies will put all of us on track to start fun and fulfilling careers.  I think that any company that is using full-stack JavaScript will be great to work for (so tired of PHP), I really like messing with game development so Zynga or some other social gaming company would be a dream.  No matter what I will definitely continue to play with game development in the amateur arena, and maybe even create the next big hit.
