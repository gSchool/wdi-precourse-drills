    <h2>A Bit of History</h2>

      I've always been a huge fan of technology, and that fascination was always supported by my family.  When I was growing up my grandmother had an Apple IIe that I played games on whenever she wasn't using it for book keeping and word processing.  When I was about six (1988) she took me to a class on putting a PC together and then let me build one, which was very exciting for a little kid like I was.  If I remember right it was something like 20MHz processor with 4MB of RAM.  Blazing speed!

      When middle school came around, I was still tinkering around with hardware and was interested in programming but didn't know where to start.  That's also when I discovered my talents in music and started spending a lot of time playing saxophone.  Since then I've tried to juggle the two passions, but the technology has been dropped for extended periods a few times.  In high school, I started playing guitar in my first band outside of the school, and also started learning C++ in AP Computer Science.  I loved programming so much and had such a strong aptitude for it that I cruised through the whole syllabus in a matter of just two weeks.  Our teacher was pretty incompetent, so I wound up doing a lot of the teaching for the rest of that course.  I continued through CSII and an independent study period my senior year in which I tried my best to make a stick figure fighting game.  I'm pretty sure it was before <a href="http://www.stickgames.com/stickfighter.html" target="_blank">Stick Fighter</a>.

      Right out of high school I started community college, but promptly started a long hiatus to pursue a career in music.  Rock and roll, baby.  For the ten or so years that followed, the extent of my coding experience was building websites for bands I played in and my landscape business that funded my music habit.  In 2013 I decided I would complete college and went back to ACC with intentions to complete a CS degree at UT, but instead I wound up landing some contract work in 2015 as a web developer at a local SaaS startup called Leading Reach.  As it turned out, I wasn't really ready for the job and my contract didn't continue, and I've basically been utilizing my talents to scrape by since.  I'm tired of scraping by. I'm ready for the <a href="later.html">future!</a>
