       I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
       I enrolled in the web development immersive because I've always been fascinated by the web's ability to bring people together.
       After Galvanize, I would love to work for a social network company like Snapchat or OKCupid.
