  <h3>Hopes and Dreams <i>etc</i>:</h3>
  <p> I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn all about the amazing things that there is to learn! I enrolled in this immersive program because I wanted to take this opportunity to better myself whether its mentally or situationally. It's amazing <em>how</em> these websites are designed to work the way they do and <em>how</em> the way these websites are designed visually, it's facinating! After Galvanize, I would love to see how I can apply what I have learned in a job that I will enjoy doing.</p>
