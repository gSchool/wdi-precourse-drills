 <h1>Career and Goals</h1>
  <p>Since I've started to learn how to code, I realized the potential of computer programming and it's unlimited potential to change the world.
    For this </br> reason I am very excited to start my future at Galvanize and learn all about web development. Once I have gathered the necessary knowledge of languages </br>
    such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I would eventually want to work for a company with world changing potentials like Google or SpaceX. My biggest goal beside </br>
    becoming a full stack developer is to take part in an application or project that can benefit the world in some way.
