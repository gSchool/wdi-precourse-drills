          <p class="profile-history">Since I was a kid, I was fascinated by techonology and its rapid progression. From TVs and computers to cars and energy, the world seemed to be advancing so quickly and I couldn't get enough of it. As I grew up, I realized that I wanted to begin learning how these things worked. After spending a couple of years at my last job, I realized that writing code on a computer was not only interesting, but also satisfying and enjoyable. With Galvanize, I plan to learn as much as I can about how the internet grows so rapidly, and the processes people use to build the most interesting websites.<br><br>After Galvanize, I plan on finding work in Colorado as a web developer while pursuing other new languages in my free time. Someday, I'd love to be creating video games that others can enjoy.</p><br><hr class="summary-hr"><br>
