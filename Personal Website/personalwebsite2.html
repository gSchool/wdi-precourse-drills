    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <div class="goals">
    <p>I knew I wanted to continue my education once I graduated from NAU but I wasn’t exactly sure which direction I wanted to go. I decided against grad school because I wanted to learn something more foreign to me and since I was a Freshman, I’ve been interested in web development so Galvanize just seemed like the natural next step for me to take. After graduation, my ideal scenario would be to go back to work for my old company either in San Francisco or their office here in Austin as a developer.</p>
