    <h3>Hawaii</h3>
    <p>I was born in Hawaii on the island of Oahu and lived on a sugar cane plantation for the first few years of my life.  My great grandparents emigrated from Japan at the turn of the 19th century, and most of my family still lives on Oahu. I grew up in the town of Mililani, which used to be a pineapple field, and left to go to college in California. <br>

    <p>The weather in Northern California is nice! But distracting when you're supposed to be studying.</p>

    <h3>New York</h3>
    <p>Immediately after college I went back to Hawaii to do an AmeriCorps program that helped victims of domestic violence get restraining orders. After that, I bought ticket to New York and lived in Brooklyn for most of my 17 years there. I worked in book publishing, got a degree in Library Science, and then helped to start a public policy debate show on public radio called Intelligence Squared U.S. &#40;IQ2&#41;. I did research, writing, and booking for IQ2 and was director of editorial operations when I left.</p>

    <h3>Colorado</h3>
    <p>My partner Dave and I moved to Denver in May 2017 to get out of the city and to have easier access to rock climbing.(Though I'm not climbing much because of 2 shoulder surgeries.) After freelance consulting for half a year, I was hired to work as the chief of staff for Senator John Kefalas for the 2018 General Assembly session. The session ended on May 9th, and now I'm here at Galvanize. </p>
