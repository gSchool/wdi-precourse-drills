    <!-- <div class="aboutme"> -->
    <p class="yes">Hi, I’m Anders but my friends call me Ders! I’m from a small town in Northern California called Petaluma. It’s about 30 minutes from San Francisco, 30 minutes from wine country, and 30 minutes from the beach!</p>
    <p class="yes">I graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2016 with a degree in strategic communication. After graduation, I moved back to California and started working as a wine consultant for a winery in Sonoma County. Once I passed my level one Sommelier exam, I left the winery to work for a start up in San Francisco… I know, super random!</p>
    <p class="yes">In my off time, my friends and I will go try out new craft breweries, wine taste, play basketball, make music, or go to the beach and just relax if it’s not too cold. I’m personally a huge soccer fan (Go Blues!), but my friends are not as enthusiastic about the sport. I also love to go camping when I can!</p>
