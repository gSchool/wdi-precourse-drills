  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Jason Hsu.  I'm a former retail manager who decided to pursue a career in web development.  I like to exercise and watch sports.  I grew up in Michigan but I'm hoping to stay in the Bay area for pretty much the rest of my life.  I have a sister who lives in Hayward,CA and my parents still live in Michigan.  During my spare time I enjoy going out with friends and trying out different restaurants and bars; something I'm really looking forward to in San Francisco.</p>
