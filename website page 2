<p>I am excited to start Galvanize.  It will be something completely different. I
  have waited tables for almost 20 years, but now it's time for something new.

  <h2 class = 'hue2'>Galvanize is a great move</h2>
  <p>I looking forward to learning web development.  I like the idea of being creative
  and problem solving.  It is a lot more involved mentally than my current job.
  </p>
  <p>I hope to learn enough to get a job at one of the many tech companies in Austin.
  I know there are more and more each week.  I hope to get an entry position that will allow
  me to learn more in the real world.  The type of company is not important to me.  I would also
  like to make my own site in the future.
