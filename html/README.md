Hyperlinks
A hyperlink, which is created with an <a> tag, enables developers to link a web-page to another (or the same) web-page.

To learn how to use hyperlinks, please read Creating Hyperlinks  .

After you're done reading, we'll apply this new knowledge to the result's page we created. Please follow these instructions:

You will not create a separate page of HTML for each movie title on the result's page. We want, however, you to gain practice with hyperlinks. Please write the code to make each movie title a hyperlink. When the link is clicked, a new tab should open. Using a relative link, have the tab open to this README.md.

You will also not create a separate page of HTML for each actor or actress. To this extent, turn every actor and actress on your result's page into a hyperlink. Have each link be an absolute path the actor or actress' page on IMDB.
