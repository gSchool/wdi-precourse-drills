                <p><em><strong>I am excited...I am terrified...I am excited again.</strong></em></p>
                        <p>These emotions have been cycling through my body ever since I decided to go through Galvanize's Immersive Web Developement program. I am sure these emotions will continue throughout the course, along with many others.</p>
                        <p>Truely, I am more excited than anything else! Because, I have goals...big goals. I would love to continue learning and building on what Galvanize teaches me through working with a team of programmers in building applications such as REI's <a href="https://www.hikingproject.com/" target="_blank">Hiking Project</a> or Andy Puddicombe's <a href="https://www.headspace.com/signup?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=818643112&utm_content=41834143173&utm_term=199115809607&andy%20puddicombe&gclid=CjwKCAjwzrrMBRByEiwArXcw22kHmgF8vXw6TqlfFohIoJvRsT66Nro6-jCNl5kl2XuTZ5JS6xBuOhoCZsUQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Headspace</a>. I am a musician at heart and where I would like to see myself in 10 years is building online and offline tools for musicians. Tools such as software and hardware similar to <a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a> and <a href="http://monome.org/" target="_blank">Monome</a>.</p>
