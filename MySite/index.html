        <!-- START BIO -->
        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in North Carolina. After finishing high school I took off to Southern Illinois to study Digital Media with an emphasis in Audio Recording. In college I found a love for a lot of different things such as art, theater, web developement, computer programming, sound design, and electronics like modular synthesis and so much more.<br>
        <br>After graduating, I moved back to North Carolina and found myself practicing graphic design and finally landing a job. I spent almost 5 years working professionally in the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Creative Suite</a>. I grew to want more, so...I moved out west to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Santa Fe is one of the most art-rich cities in the United States. My time there was a struggle with not a whole lot of opportunity. However I <em>was</em> given the opportunity to work with the talented people at <a href="https://meowwolf.com/" target="_blank"> Meow Wolf</a>, where they showed me the true power of programming. This is where my love for coding began.<br>
        <br>Since my time in Santa Fe was not progressing like I had hoped, I decided to move to a larger city with a bit more growth. About 6 hours north, Denver, Colorado seemed like a good fit. At the moment I am studing to be a Web Developer at Galvanize, a bootcamp for those aspiring to be programmers in the Denver area.</p>

                                <p>Audio is one of my deepest passions. Since I can remember, I have been recording audio of all kinds. From when I was a kid sneaking in on my parents by placing a tape recorder in their room to find out where my Christmas presents may be hidden, to recording other bands and writing my own music.</p>

                                    <h3>Web Developement</h3>
                                    <p>I was first introduced to programming in college. I took an intro class for HTML and CSS and I fell in love with it, but the web is so much more than HTML/CSS. I later took a class in computer programming and grew an understanding for basic algorithms that made me want to take on JavaScript. So when I moved to Denver, Colorado in 2017 I jumped into a foundations class at Galvanize with the hope to go through their immersive, full-stack program.</p>

                                    <p>I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico from July 2015 to March 2017. During that time I learned a lot about its people, culture, and land. It had a huge impact on me; so much so that I began to write a musical album based off of the state. The album intertwines autobiographical events with New Mexico myth and folklore. The album is set to release August of 2017.</p>
