                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <p>In case you missed it, my name is Grace. I went to UT initially for geology but then switched to ecology,
                        then to microbiology and infectious disease, and finally to public health. I'm interested in programming
                        because I feel that it provides the opportunity for me to stay mentally active and use the skills I 
                        picked up and developed over the course of my life. Mainly musically and mathematically.
                        <br></br>I went to the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Houston, TX and majored in vocal performance--I wanted 
                        to study piano but my wrist was fractured when I was supposed to have my audition. I took piano lessons
                        for 17 years and was a paid singer in a number of settings throughout high school. Despite having grown up in Houston,
                        I've never felt attached to it and have always claimed Evanston, IL as my hometown since that's where my Dad grew up,
                        a large portion of my his family still lives there, and we spent a lot of time there growing up. Even still, my goal is to 
                        move to the PNW region within the next year. Cannot do another Texas summer... 
                        <br></br>We have a cat named Captain who's a 5 year old Korat mix and she runs the show, and a polar-wolf thing (allegedly a Pyrenees-Husky)
                        named Lieutenant ("Lieu") who just turned 3 and is this pretty much the size of a miniature pony. He's way too
                        chill to run anything; instead, he solicits attention and affection.
                        <br></br>We go through an ungodly amount of coffee at our apartment (longstanding favorites are Death Wish and Hunter Bay's 
                        Smoke Jumper). Fun bit: Dillon was on an interagency hotshot crew for a few years so Smoke Jumper has a little bit 
                        of an extra meaning--other than being from Montana. On another aside, go watch the movie "Only the Brave". It's about 
                        a hotshot crew from Arizona who suffered a horrible tragedy. It's very sad but extremely good. Going back to coffee,
                        I recently learned that if you drink a ton of coffee on an empty stomach over a long period of time, you'll probably
                        get stomach ulcers, and stomach ulcers are just about the worst.

                    <p> TLDR: I went on a climbing trip in May 2016 with a couple of my buddies and took a 30-35ft. unprotected fall 
                        when a piece of the rock fell off. I broke a considerable amount of myself and had to relearn just about 
                        everything. There's a follow-up video that you can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/ofLXilzfhG4" style="color:#555f88bd;">here</a>. </p>
