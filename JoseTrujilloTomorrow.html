<p>I've been involved in the general software world for about a decade now, but my role has been on the front line assisting with user issues. I've been good at it overall, but diving deeper into the tech world is something I should have done years ago.</p>

<h2><center>In with the New</center></h2>
<p>I am excited to learn a slew of new skills and refine the entry level ones I have now. I find solving problems to be an exciting endeavor and I know that the skillset I'm going to learn here will help put my web development career on track.</p>
