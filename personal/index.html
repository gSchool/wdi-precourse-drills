    <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
    <p class="aboutMe">Originally from Florida, I've been a Phoenix resident for many years now. An Avid gamer, I have lived many virtual lives, whether marching across Azeroth with friends as a dwarf warrior, exploring a lonely, ruined kingdom in search of a princess or putting a fist through a demons face, I enjoy many game genres.</p>

    <p class="aboutMe">When I’m not playing games or watching movies, I’m fixing something. From repairing my car to updating my home, I like to be hands on and solve problems. I love to learn new things! My Hobbies have included playing piano, photography, woodworking and more. There's never enough time to get to everything, but I try!</p>
