<h1>A little bit about myself..</h1>
  <p>My name is Tim Kozemzak. I grew up in Washington state in a small town. I enjoyed living in the country and spent my time exploring
    the woods, off-roading, swimming, and much more. I grew up in a valley full of farms, so traffic being held up by a tractor on the road
    was not unheard of!</p>

    <p>I started getting into computers and technology around the age of 8. It started with video games, then led to modifying PC's,
      then led to building PC's from scratch and taking soldering/electronic classes. The interest in coding came much later, very recently actually.
      Discovering more and more about the coding world made me more interested as time went on. The more I learned about it I realized
      how much I'd love to go into a career involving it.</p>

    <h1>Regarding Galvanize</h1>

      <p>I can't express how happy I am to begin my journey at Galvanize! Learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the past few months
        has gotten me very excited about broadening my knowledge about more and more languages. I look forward to training my mind to learn
        efficiently and being able to use my skills towards more in-depth projects.</p>

      <h1>Jquery integration</h1>
        <p>Below I have a button labeled "Click me". As you can tell, if you hover over the button,
          it will illuminate. If you click it, an alert will pop up. I was able to integrate this from
          learning the basics of Jquery.(And using google to find out how to load the Jquery library
          into my site!)
