   <p>Hello! My name is Peter Chun. I was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee. As a child, I have always had a love for animals and music.</p>
   <p>Growing up in Nashville, also known as the "Music City", many of my friends' parents were either in the music industry or were musicians, so I was introduced to the live music scene early. I started piano lessons at the age of five, and also took violin lessons. I also taught myself how to play the guitar in middle school. To this day, one of my favorite hobbies is to go see live music. I am so grateful that the world famous Red Rocks Amphitheatre is just a few minutes away from me, where so many famous acts come play every summer.</p>
   <p>I went to college at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and received my Bachelor of Science degree in Animal Science and a minor in Wildlife and Fisheries Science. While in school, I began my professional career in wildlife conservation, working at a zoo and later, a wildlife rehabiliation center. About six months after graduating college, I decided to move away from my hometown to a bigger city, and I chose Denver, Colorado. Once I moved to Denver, I began working for the University of Colorado Denver at the Anschutz Campus. I started off as an animal care technician, and soon became a mouse breeding specialist for the Office of Laboratory Animal Resources. A few years later, I accepted a position as a Professional Research Assistant working in the Gnotobiotic (Germ-free) Core. After working in the Gnotobiotic facility for a little less than a year, I became the manager for the core. I was beginning to realize that I wanted to move on from the research world and I started looking into the posibility of a career change, which brings me to today.</p>
   <p>I also enjoy traveling and photography. My goal is to visit at least two new cities every year. In 2017, I was able to visit Portland, OR and Seattle, WA for the first time. After I got back home from this trip, I decided to try editing a short video for the first time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUDjtMk65Es&t=1s">Click Here</a> to check out my first travel video.</p>
