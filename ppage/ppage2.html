    <h2>Interest in Programming</h2>
    <p>I think that my interest in programming ultimately comes from all of the nerdy games I played growing up. Growing up I played a lot of video games and spent a lot of time painting miniatures to play the tabletop game Warhammer 40k.  I had a handful of nerdy friends that I did all of this with and I was always the one to learn the rules to any game we played. I don't know why, but I loved learning the rules and winning games through my understanding of them.  More recently I played some games of Dungeons and Dragons and I started to notice that if I have enough structure and rules, I am actually more free to be creative.  I started exploring that side of myself more and more and found that I really enjoy programming.  It feels like I am using rules to solve complex logic puzzles.<p/>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I find that one of the most attractive things about learning Languagues like HTML and Javascript is the limitless opportunities that it presents.  After working at a rapidly scaling business I learned that I thrive in that environment.  I think that one of the best ways for me to grow is to surround myself with smart people and challenge myself to do new things.  I have recently been taking a lot of interest in blockchain technology but I am excited to learn more about the different paths available to me with a web development education.
