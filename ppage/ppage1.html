    <h2>Maryland</h2>
    <img src="maryland.jpg">
    <p>I was born in Silver Spring, Maryland which is right outside of Washington DC.  My family moved to Howard County, Maryland when I was in the second grade and that is where I spent the rest of my childhood.  I spent a lot of time on the water growing up.  We lived right next to the Triadelphia reservoir and had a garage full of kayaks and canoes. I also have fond memories of catching blue crabs and fishing for striped bass on the Chesapeake Bay. After graduating from high school I attended college in West Virgina at Shepherd University where I studed business and sociology</p>
    <h2>Colorado</h2>

    <p>The summer before my senior year in College a friend of mine and I decided to road trip across the country and see what the West had to offer.  The first time I saw the Rocky Mountains I fell in love.  I moved to Denver immediately after graduation in 2009 and haven't looked back.  I had just arrived in Denver and was hungry to meet new people.  I found community in the rapidly growing craft beer industry.  I started spening more time immersing myself in that culture and eventually took a job at Renegade Brewing Company working in the taproom and helping with the sales program.  I spent the following 6 years as the Sales Manager there and that is where I met my lovely wife Laura.  We now live in the Baker neighborhood with three cute cats named Slate, Cinder, and Pepper.</p>
