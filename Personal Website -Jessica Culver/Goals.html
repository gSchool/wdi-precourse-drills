I'm super excited to start this program! I began learning Python and SQL almost three years ago. Originally, I was more interested in Data Science, but it turns out I can only handle so much statistics. Plus, I really enjoy experimenting in web development. I'm excited to start learning more of the backend. I've used SQL to query data, but I want to learn how to connect web applications to a database and extracting information. I'm also interested in learning UI/UD so I can make my applications more user-friendly. As of right now, I'm open to where I want to work after the program, but I'm leaning towards education or government sector.
