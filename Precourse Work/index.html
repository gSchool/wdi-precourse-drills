			Hi, my name is Ryder Dale. More and more I will fill this websie with ideas, thoughts, and the happenings that speak to my passions. <br> <br>

			From time to time, collaborative invitations can also be found here.<br><br>

			Currently a part-time student and full-time entrepreneur, I like to dream and build, with the help from friends. These ideas to then businesses aim to provide solutions that improve the efficiency of people's lives and allow stakeholders to get more for what they truly enjoy, providing what helps them most to make the best life for themselves.<br><br>

			The attainment of the skills and knowledge that enable people to build and grow should only be limited by the ambition and passion of each individual and his or her dreams - ambition being a short-term driver, which, with such strength, enables endurance to a better future; and for that passion is the only true long-term driver, for the construction of dreams and discovery for personal growth. <br> <br>

			It's worth remembering when pondering our advantages, that the pursuance of individual wealth and a better world for everyone are not exclusive but mutually dependent, and the enlightened values that we carry forward will exponentially compound for the future of the world for the life we all help to continue forward. <br> <br>

			With transparency and full availability of knowledge present and a lack of barriers to skills and opportunity, follow through is up to individual intention. We must find a harmony within ourselves and all that surrounds us. Such a karmic loop fuels growth and is perpetuated by movement with purpose of positive intention to results. <br> <br>

			This site serves in part to help inform the world of me as one of the many people with interests in this collaboration. <br> <br>

			Although much of what I spend time on these days is for long-term results, one can't healthfully sustain life without immediate satisfaction. With one lean scrap page and more to come, here is what I am building and here is a piece of what I've been entertaining with my passions. <br> <br>

			Please contact me with feedback, discussion, venture, adventure, or anything I might be able to help you with at
