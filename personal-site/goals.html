          <h3>Career Goals:</h3>
          <p>I initially started programming and coding with a love for the front end, and the desire to build websites and applications that people could use and interact with. Over time though, I feel drawn to a backend role, and I like the idea of being able to build the foundation for most modern web apps.</p>
          <p>I would like to work with a company that will allow me to grow and develop, and gives me the opportunity to gradually take on new and exciting challenges.</p>

          <h3>Education Goals:</h3>
          <p>Prior to starting at Galvanize, I have been taking classes for about two years from sites like Code School and Treehouse.</p>
          <p>Most recently I finished a Udacity Nanodegree in full stack web development, which focused on front end principles of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and design fundamentals. The backend was mostly using Python and SQL Lite which were mostly new to me.</p>
          <p>Long term, I would like to pursue a masters in computer science once I am established in the field and know more about the direction I want to take. The area most interesting to me is machine learning as I think it is a field that will continue to change the way humans interact with technology.</p>

          <h3>Hopes and Dreams:</h3>
          <p>The four main areas I regularly think about and reflect upon are my relationships, my career, my health, and my passions. I try to focus each and every day on how I can make those areas of my life better, because that is how I would define myself.</p>
