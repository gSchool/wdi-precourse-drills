        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am a pianist with pretensions to become a web developer too.</p>
        <p>I am an adventurous, dreamy, determined and art lover person. I like to create and communicate things. And since I am also a curious person, I like to explore in general, I mean, places, new technologies, new cultures with their meals, music,
          traditions, etc.</p>
        <p>When I was 4 years old I started playing piano and since then I have not stopped.<br>I begun my musical studies at the “University of Andes Music School” in the city of Merida, which is located in the mountains of the Venezuelan Andes. When I
          was twenty years old, I moved to Moscow to continue my studies at the Moscow State Conservatory P. I. Tchaikovsky. Then I moved to Barcelona (Spain) where I graduated in The Bachelor of Music in the specialty of Piano at the Liceu Conservatory.</p>
        <p>After some years living and working in Barcelona I decided to move and see what other opportunities I could find in other parts of the world. That decision led me to spend some time living in: London, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Breckenridge, Padua,
          Boulder and now Denver.</p>

        <h2>MY FAMILY</h2>
        <p>I was born in the city of Merida. My mother is from Merida and my father is from Italy. I am an only child and I have been very fortunate to grow up with the influence of their two cultures.</p>
        <p>When I was living in Barcelona I met the one who is now my husband. He is from the United States and for almost 8 years he has been my companion in adventures.</p>
        <p>And the other part of my family are my friends, that although they are a little scattered on all continents, thanks to technology the distances simply disappear.
