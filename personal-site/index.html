          <h3>About Me:</h3>
          <p>My name is Ryan Wittrup and I am an aspiring web developer and backend engineer.</p>
          <p>I was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio and went to the University of Dayton where I majored in chemical engineering.</p>
          <p>I first was introduced to programming and coding in a freshman workshop where we used Lego Mindstorms to build cars which would use a vision system to follow a small course.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
          <p>In my freetime I try to stay active. I ski in the winters and play volleyball and softball once spring and summer come.</p>
          <p>I also go to the gym and practice yoga and meditation several times a week - it's always good to just step back and take a breath sometimes.</p>
          <p>One new skill I'm trying to learn is drawing and painting. I have a long ways to go, but I especially would like to get in to watercolors and urban sketching - I love how raw and intimate it can be to just put to paper something ordinary but in an extraordinary way.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Family and Friends:</h3>
          <p>My family is relatively small, and almost everybody is still in the Cleveland area.</p>
          <p>I'm an only child (though not <i>too</i> socially awkward) and my parents live in a suburb about 20 minutes from the city.</p>
          <p>I'm also fortunate to have friends who have gone on to live all around the country. It means a few trips each year to Denver, Chicago, Seattle, and Las Vegas which are always a good time.</p>
