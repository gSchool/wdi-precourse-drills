            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Ed. I was born Vermont and spent my my first
            19 years of life exploring the green mountains in the north east. In
            my youth,  I enjoyed playing soccer, lacrosse, camping, and water
            sports. At age 19 I moved to Colorado for college where I spent 3
            years at CU studying human physiology before becoming employed at a
            startup. The company, eGauge Systems, manufactures smart meters for
            measuring electricity (<a
            href="http://www.egauge.net/">egauge.net</a>). After four years
            working in sales and digital marketing, I went back to CU and
            concurrently completed a degree in human physiology. Almost exactly
            a year later, here we are...
            </p>
            <p>I was introduced to web development at eGauge where I was in
            charge of designed and implimenting much of the company website,
            along with other marketing related tasks. When I was bored, or
            wasn't sure what to work on, I improved the features and user
            experince of our website. Finally, I decided to commit to learning
            the craft formally.
            </p>
            <h2>How I feel about starting Galvanize...</h2>
            <div class="group">
              <div class="float-left w6">
                <p>I've met several web developers throughout my professional
                career who graduated from a dev bootcamp and highly recommended
                it. Those who I worked with directly often suggested that I
                should take one because of my experience and interest. I see
                Galvanize immersive as a way to become qualified for a new
                career very quickly.
