<b> Hello Again! </b>
    </p>
<p>
  I started my path towards web development by participating in ASU's Digital Culture Major. It's a degree where you're able to learn everything about creating something digitally. It had an array of different specialties within the major so my first year I tried everything. The only common enjoyment I had between my classes is when I was creating something through codes. I realized then I wanted to become a Web Developer and I started asking how to do so, and the consensus was to attend a Web Development Program. I searched through many different programs to see which one I could excel in and Galvanize was a perfect fit.
</p>
<p>
  I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies so I can begin my creative career in Web Development. Eventually, I would love to help others create their ideas via web pages, so after Galvanize I plan on gaining experience in a reputable company and then moving on to be a consultant.
