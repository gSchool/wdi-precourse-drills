  		<p>
  			Hello!  My name is Jacob Crane.  I was born December 1st, 1989 in Brandon, Florida.  My father was working for my grandfather on a construction job down there.  My parents moved to Colorado soon after and I grew up in Aurora.

  			Growing up I did all kinds of activities.  I took Taekwondo lessons, played sports, acted in plays, skateboarded, and even tried to start a band.  Once I got to High School, my friends convinced me to play Lacrosse.  I was hooked on the sport and immediately did everything I could to get my grades up and get better at Lacrosse in order to play in college.  I played at two different schools and coached at my High School after college.

  			Since college, I have been a personal trainer at 24 Hour Fitness.  My clients were amazing and many have become my closest friends.  One in particular introduced me to coding.  Since his help, I have decided to further advance my skills in computer programming. <a href="future.html" target="_blank">You can read more about my aspirations here </a>.

  			As far as my social life, I enjoy many different things in my down time.  Most of all, I enjoy time with my beautiful wife, Ashley!  We love to hike, try new foods, go on dates and work on our house.  I also have a group of frineds that plays Magic: The Gathering roughly twice a month.
