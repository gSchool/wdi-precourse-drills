	<h1> My goals: </h1>

<h2> Current goals </h2>

 <p> My current goals are to focus on studying and to try to make it more enjoyable and less stressful. I always enjoyed studying new information and developing new skills. It is very satisfying to get to the point where you understand something that you did not understand before. </p>

 <p> I really liked the section of pre-course materials about studying. It helped me to reassess my studying habits. I plan to implement several techniques to make my learning process more efficient.</p>

 <p> Since I am new to programming, it feels overwhelming because of the amount of material that needs to be mastered. So I just have to remind myself the saying “Rome was not built in a day” and to be patient and persistent.</p>

  <h2> Looking to the Future </h2>

  <p> When I graduate from Galvanize, I would like to work for a company that has positive work culture and healthy teamwork. Ideally, it would be located in a walking distance from my current residence :) </p>

  <p> I also would like to go on a cruise from San Francisco to Hawaii someday, maybe after graduation. I went on a cruise to Mexico several years ago and I really liked the experience. </p>
