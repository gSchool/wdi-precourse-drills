<h2> My story </h2>

<img id="p1" src="data/n629.jpg" alt="Hawaii">

  <p> My name is Nataliya Gapochka. I was born in Ukraine,
  a nice country the size of Texas. </p>

  <p> I moved to Odessa after my graduation from high school.
     Odessa is a very beautiful city; in many aspects it reminds me of San Francisco.
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa" target="_blank"> Odessa </a>  is also a tourist destination and
     has many beautiful landmarks and old buildings. Some parts of the city have hills,
     but not as dramatic as those of San Francisco.
     Another similarity is that Odessa is also located near water on the shores of Black Sea.
     The difference is that in summer you can swim in the Black Sea as the water gets very
     nice and warm. That is one of the things I still miss, since you can’t really swim in the ocean here.</p>
<br>
 <p> When we moved to the United States with my husband, our first destination was Texas.
     It was nice living in Austin, which is quite a pretty and diverse city.
     One of the things I miss about Texas is BBQ as for some reason BBQ here is not as tasty.
     The same thing with Hot&amp;Sour soup; somehow in most Texas Chinese restaurants the soup is really good.
     But here in California the Hot&amp;Sour soup even looks different and doesn’t taste as good.</p>
<br>
 <p> So I have been living in San Francisco for several years now, and I really
     like the city. I like that everything is close and I can walk to the stores, to the movies,
     and that transportation is very abundant. I also like that there are several Russian stores in San Francisco,
      I particularly like
     <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/europa-express-2-san-francisco" target="_blank"> this store </a> on
     the Ocean beach.</p>

  <h2 id="park"> Golden Gate Park. </h2>

<div class="park">
  <p>It is one of the largest parks in the city. Before I lived in San Francisco, I thought that Golden Gate park was adjacent to Golden Gate bridge because of their names.</p>
  <p>That proved to be wrong; however Golden Gate bridge is adjacent to the different park called Presidio.</p>
  <p>Since Golden Gate park is so huge, it has many different points of interest.</p>
  <p> <em>Several places that I like:</em><p>

  <h2 id="hobby"> My hobbies. </h2>

  <ul>
      <li> Traveling and hiking. One of the things I like about living in the Bay Area is that there are so many
        beautiful places here.</li>
      <li> Knitting, crochet, beading and jewelry making. I also enjoy customizing things like clothes,
        furniture, or anything really, when I get inspired. </li>
      <li> Watching movies and TV series. I especially enjoy Sci-Fi. Some of my favorites:</li>
