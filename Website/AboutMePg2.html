  <h1>Desired Outcomes from Web Development Program</h1>
<p>I have always been a very analytical thinker, so making this move into the world of coding just makes sense.</br>
  In college I didn't even know taking the computer science route was an option, so 3 years after graduating</br>
  college and working in tech in a non tech capacity has lead me to this fork in the road.  I am hoping </br>
  that after the Web Development immersive program that I will be able to land a position as a junior</br>
  dev at one of the many great tech companies in Colorado.  My hope is to work for a company that provides</br>
  a technology driven service that gives back to society in some way.</p>
