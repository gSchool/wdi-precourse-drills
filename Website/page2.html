    <h1>My Future as A Web Developer</h1>
<p>
I have been learning web development over the past 4 months. It has been very challenging at times</br>
and a lot of fun. The past 10 years of my career have been spent working in some kind of</br>
intensive care setting in the Hospital. So this has been a very big change and new skill set to learn.</br>
Through my experaince so far I think I will gravitate towards the front-end design. </br>
But who knows maybe I will end up enjoying the back-end more after Gschool is finished.</br>
