        <p> While my knowledge with coding is small, and the world of coding is large, its tough for me to say where exactly this new path will take me. <br> However, I am interested in exploring the avenues where coding and music meet. I have seen many interesting instances of programmers using their knowledge <br> to contribute to the music world. Heres a link to one such example I find really cool. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freedrum/freedrum-the-drumkit-that-fits-in-your-pocket" target="_blank"> Freedrum. </a> <br>
          The realm of coding in video games is another area I would like to investigate. As I have read about code being used to generate seemingly endless variations of planets, <br> life forms, fauna and flora, on a massive scale. Simply by looping through a certain line of code. I know very little else about this area, but would like to explore it nonetheless. </p>

          <p> I've found there to be many similarities between learing to code, and learning how to play an instrument. Mainly that, it will NOT happen when I want it to. No matter how badly <br> I want to understand a concept, the understanding will not arrive until I have spent enough time with it. Even after 10 years of playing guitar, I would hardly consider myself a master of it by any means. <br> The advantages of spending so much time on something is that once you have built your foundation, you can learn to be expressive. Once you have learned how to express yourself through music, its simply <br> an act of learning new techniques, adding new methods to your arsenal. I can say the same for coding, it will simply be a matter of time before I can express myself through different functions and methods of using code. <br> I am excited to finally pick up traction and learn how I can be expressive in the coding world, in a way which will be both challenging and fulfilling.</p>

          <p>
            But for now, coding feels, a bit like this:
