    <p>After finishing the immersive, I would like to work on a team of experienced developers learning as much as I possibly can for a few years. Once I feel like I have learned enough, I would like to start my own company, contracting out my work to other companies. However, I am excited to see how my plans change as I make my way into and through this industry!</p>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to travel the world via motorcycle, experiencing as much as I possibly can while I am young and healthy. I'm hoping to build a life for myself that will allow this to happen.</p>
