  <h1>Who Is Cory Pease</h1>
  <img src="../Pictures/siblings.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Well Literally:</h2>
  <p>I'm a 27 year old human. On the planet earth, which is round but I'll hear you out because it'll be fun. I have 6 sisters and brothers who have 5 brothers and sister, so pretty big family.</p>

  <h3>(I'm also a new <em>pretty awesome</em> <b>Uncle!</b>)</h3>
  <h2>Why I'm Here:</h2>
  <p>I'm in this immersive for the traditional reason:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Money</li>
    <li>Flexibiliy</li>
    <li>Prestege</li>
    <li>The Challenge</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Where I'm From:</h2>
  <p>I was born bred and fed Denver, CO. I grew up in the Five Points and Park Hill area when it was cheap and kinda sketchy. I went to East High School, would be class of '09, opted for my G.E.D. when I was 15.</p>
  <h2>What I've Done for Work:</h2>
  <h3>(First to Last - ish)</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Construction Clean-Up</li>
    <li>Bus Boy</li>
    <li>Cook</li>
    <li>Forklift Operator</li>
    <li>Theather Usher</li>
    <li>Call Center Agent</li>
    <li>Waiter</li>
    <li>Pizza Delivery</li>
    <li>Uber Driver</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How'd I End Up Here:</h2>
  <p>Well I've dabble in tech more or less my whole life but mostly on a consumer or customer support basis, no coding. I've researched different options over the past couple years it and it all came down to: A) I was going to teach myself or B) come hear. I chose to come to Galvanzie to be surrounded by people I could relate to and network with, rather than sitting in the basement telling myself <em>I'm learning to code.</em></p>
