Who is Cory Pease?
He is but a mere mortal......
Well that's what they'll tell you anyways!
He can't be stopped, he won't be stopped!
For he is all that is man!

The year was 1991
53 years after the great Etta James was born
From birth Cory had to fight for his life
Stuck behind his Mother's pelvic bone
Cory entered the world without oxygen
Skin purple as if he were a crayon not a baby
