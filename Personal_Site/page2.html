        <p>I'm excited to start the Web Development course because I've always
        to have a job where I would be working with computers. Web Development
        really interested me because everyone uses the web and I want to work on and
        improve something that affects people on such a massive scale like the world
        wide web. I would love to work for a large company like Google or possibly
        work indepedently. The great thing about web development is the flexibility
        you can have with your work schedule if you work independently.</p>
