      <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Hyatt and I'm attending the Web Development Course
      on July 10th. I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and I've lived in the bay area for
      most of my life. I used to work as a baker at french bakery for over a year while
      I went to community college but I decided to quit both of those things to pursue
      web development. My closest friend lives in Michigan and I recently went on a roadtrip
      where I stopped in Michigan and we both went to the Anime Expo convention in LA. Making
      that drive in 5 days is honestly one of my biggest accomplishments.</p>
      <ul><em>My Hobbies include:</em>
        <li>Building model kits</li>
        <li>Watching Anime</li>
        <li>Roadtrips</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li>Driving my car</li>
      </ul>
