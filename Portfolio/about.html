  <p id="about-me">Born and raised in Boise, Idaho, I grew up loving outdoor activities
    like snowboarding, hiking, camping, and biking.  I also developed quite the love
    for video games, which I think eventually led to my interest in computers and tech
    in general. My family relocated to Illinois, where I attended high school.  I
    couldn't wait to move back west.  In 2010 I chose to attend CU Boulder, where
    I picked up numerous hobbies including fire-based circus performing arts.  My interest
    and involvement in this community is how I met my boyfriend, Kody, nearly five years ago.
    Today we share an apartment in Broomfield with our poodle Mr. Beau Jangles.
    We enjoy most of the same things we did five years ago like art, snowboarding, live music,
    cooking, and spending time with our friends and families.  Although, we know we are
    getting older as we now also thoroughly enjoy home improvement projects, exercising regularly, and
    the thrill of replacing a dirty kitchen sink sponge with a fresh one.  I am grateful for Kody who has
    been my number one supporter over the last five years, and has been the greatest
    impetus in my decision to attend Galvanize and pursue a new career.</p>
