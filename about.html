            <p>A few years from now, I hope to be a full stack developer for a company that encourages innovation, that fosters creativity, and that will help me grow as a person and as a young professional. I also wish to take the skills I gain at Galvanize and use them to develop a youth education program that teaches and encourages kids to explore coding and computer science. </P>
						<p>I'm an expert on How Not To Get Trampled By An Elephant. When I'm not working, I'm usually either reading or exploring the city. I'm a neurotic minimalist; I can fit all of my belongings in a truck, and this includes furnishings. I always have the key code to Red Headed Step Child, so give me a shout-out if you want it. I was born in Texas and have no intention of ever leaving Austin, not unless it's to see my partner, who lives halfway across the world in Botswana (pictured below).<br></p><br><br>
