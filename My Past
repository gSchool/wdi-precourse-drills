    <h2 class="hidden">Hello everyone! My name is Luke Romberg.</h2>
      <p class="hidden">I was born in California on August 11th, 1994. I moved to colorado with my family
      when I was only 5 years old. <br>I have 4 sisters (it was definitely easier than having 4 brothers).<br>
      I attended Jim Elliot Christian School from 8th grade till my graduation. <br><br>After High School I tried
      community college for two semesters and hated it. <br>I dropped out and started helping my Dad with his
      Plumbing company. <br>He desperately needed someone to bring him into the 21st century, so I became his
      technical support team. <br><br>While I was helping him with his site and digital advertising, I found myself falling
      in love with the process. <br>So, about a year ago I helped my personal trainer build himself a digital training site.<br>
      After a few more clients, I realized I needed help learning the crazy world of web-dev. <br><br>That brings us to now, where
      I'm creating a site to tell you all how excited I am for Galvanize!</p>
