	<br><br>Hello, I’m Ryan Borgstrom.  I come from a small town 60 miles south of Chicago called Morris, Illinois. I graduated from West Virginia University in 2017 as I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Strategic Communications with a focus in Advertising and a minor in Electronic Media.  
	I enjoy working with programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Premiere Pro. <br><br>

I love to travel and experience new places around the globe. I recently got back from a 44 day adventure in Europe where I was able to explore 10 different countries. <br><br>
