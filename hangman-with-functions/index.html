	<!--A lot of what I did here was pieced together bit by bit from the information that I learned on both Free Code Camp & Code Academy.  I realize that I have a lot to learn and a lot of this code (especially on the stylesheet) is exhaustive and at times redundant.  I put this website together for my Galvanize Admissions Portfolio Project: Standard 3. Please have a look around! -->
