<div class="about">
  <p>Hello, my name is David J. Miller and I am an aspiring web developer.  I am currently teaching myself how to code, starting with the basics of html/css, and JavaScript. This is a very crude and early example of my skills but hey, ya got to start somewhere, right? Bare with me... this is a work in progress.</p>

<!--Here I just copied the main index and did this for each page of my site as I wanted it to look identical on each page. I did my best to show examples of using links and adding buttons to my page but it is still nowhere near as good as I imagined it in my head.  I look forward to building up my skills to the point where I can actually bring to life what I dream up in my head. My goal was also to link my GitHub account on this page but at this time, it just contains basically the same files as you'll find here.-->
