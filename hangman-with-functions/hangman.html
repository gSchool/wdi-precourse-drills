<!--I learned how to code this game from the book JavaScript for Kids. I worked it out step by step and got the game working well, however there was a bug in the code (at least in my copy of JS for Kids). The bug would still give you the final word and congratulate the player as if he/she guessed the proper word even if the player hit cancel at the very beginning of the game.  Through a process of trial and error I was able to fix this bug by using another condional at the end of the game loop.-->
