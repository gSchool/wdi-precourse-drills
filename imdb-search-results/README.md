This is the README.


Please follow these instructions:

You will not create a separate page of HTML for each movie title on the
result's page. We want, however, you to gain practice with hyperlinks.
Please write the code to make each movie title a hyperlink. When the
link is clicked, a new tab should open. Using a relative  link, have
the tab open to this README.md.

You will also not create a separate page of HTML for each actor or
actress. To this extent, turn every actor and actress on your result's
page into a hyperlink. Have each link be an absolute path the actor or
actress' page on IMDB.
