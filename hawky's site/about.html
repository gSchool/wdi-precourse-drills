<div class="about">
  <p class="fade">Hello, my name is David J. Miller and I am an aspiring web developer.
		I am currently teaching myself how to code, starting with the basics of html/css, and JavaScript.
		This is a very crude and early example of my skills but hey, ya got to start somewhere, right?
		Bare with me... this is a work in progress. I have just learned the basics of jQuery and I did a little nifty
	  slideUp/slideDown trick here (you see it when the page first loads) and for some reason it really excites me!  I'll be playing
		around with jQueary a lot more in the future on this site so bare with me as I get things up and running.</p>
		<p>The picture below is a picture of my amazingly awesome dog, Lilah. She's been my sidekick for 11 years now.
			 <img class="lilah" src="littles.jpg" alt="picture"/>
       Here we are hanging out at Anderson Mill Park under a nice shady tree.  We visit this spot everyday after
			 I get off work but unfortunately, she'll be living with my parents during the time I'm in the Galvanize web
			 Devloper Immersive program, as I'll just be gone to long during the day to tend to her needs. We will re-unite when I
			 graduate from the course, I'll absolutely miss her but it's a sacrifice I have to make and this gives her an
			 oppurtunity to have a much better life durning the next six months. My parents live on 5 acres of land and I've
			 always considered it "doggie heaven" up there.
		</p>
		<p>I'm also a proud father of a little baby girl... well she's not so little anymore, as the making of this site
			she is 15 months old and will be 16 months old this coming May, on the 14th. Here is a picture of Esmé & I on the
			back porch of my brand new apartment.
			<img class="esme" src="esme.jpg" alt="picture"/>
			She is an absolute angel (in my eyes) and the only girl to ever "really" steal my heart.  She actually is my heart, my
			light, my soul, my anchor, my world.  Before having a baby for myself, I never thought I could love a human being
			as much as I love that girl! Her full name is Esmé Linn Miller, her initials spell ELM and I'm contemplating getting
			my first tattoo of some cool looking Elm tree to symbolize my love for her but as of right now the thought of it is still
			germinating, it's not even a seedling just yet.
		</p>
		<p>I'm starting the Web Development Immersive course at Galvanize on April 30th 2018 and this about wraps up how I feel
			about that...
      <iframe class="excited" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/DearSoggyGrasshopper"></iframe>

			I look forward to meeting everyone at Galvanize and I can't wait to have a transformative experience! See ya'll soon!

<!--Here I just copied the main index and did this for each page of my site as I wanted it to look identical on each page. I did my best to show examples of using links and adding buttons to my page but it is still nowhere near as good as I imagined it in my head.  I look forward to building up my skills to the point where I can actually bring to life what I dream up in my head. My goal was also to link my GitHub account on this page but at this time, it just contains basically the same files as you'll find here.-->
