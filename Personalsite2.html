<p>When I graduate Galvanize I hope to work with a startup and learn as much as I can. I want to learn as many langauges as I possible can, including objective c. I would then like to be able to develop my own program or app and hopefully turn it into a business or sell it for a profit. I would love to just develop my own projects and sell them off and then retire before I turn 40.</p>
