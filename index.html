                    Hello, my name is Jason Dulin. I was born in California, raised in Illinois, and moved to Colorado after graduate school at San Diego State University.
                    My program was Bioinformatics, where I started to find a significant interest in the coding aspects of the courses. After graduation, I started taking
                    online coding courses and decided I wanted to transition towards Web Development. Once I heard about Galvanize, I thought this would be a great opportunity
                    to build a foundation for a career in Web Development.
