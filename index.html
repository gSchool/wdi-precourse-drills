            You're a corporation racing against others to profit from terraforming Mars, that is, making it habitable for human dwelling. Together, you and other players raise the temperature, increase oxygen, and turn valleys into oceans. The twist is that some
            cards can only be played when these parameters are above or below a certain level, and you'll have to decide which cards to invest in each round.

            Set in an alternate 1920s European history and featuring beautiful painterly artwork, Scythe lets you build your own conquest. Whether by farming, charming, battling, or building, how you express your dominance is up to you. With so much going on, Scythe
            could easily feel like it's in disarray, but its simple action-selection system makes it surprisingly easy to teach.

            Patchwork brings that satisfying Tetris "piece that fits just right" feeling to board games. Your goal is to assemble a quilt out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino">tetromino shapes</a>, covering as many squares as you can.
            Of course, each piece costs time and, ahem, buttons, to stich. So which patch should you buy? The one shaped just right? The smaller one that can be stitched quick? An odd shape that will increase your button production? Patchwork brings interesting
            decisions to a compact, delightful, and quick-to-learn package.
