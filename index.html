   <p> About myself: </p>
   <p> I'm Edison. I like movies, music, computers, and cool stuff that makes me say "wow".
     I was born in Atlanta GA, but moved to Florida and then Colorado in January 2017 for the engineering
     program at CU Boulder, but that fell through within a semester (long story short).
    I live with my mom, brother, and roommate, James (who i brought from Florida). I had another friend
    from Florida living with us before James, but he suffered a TBI via a car accident last August and he's back in Florida now. My girlfriend of 5 years is still in Florida also,
    but we're still going strong don't worry.
