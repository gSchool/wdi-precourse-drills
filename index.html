    <p> <strong> Welcome!</strong> My name is Ian, allow me to tell you a little about myself. </p>

    <h2> Personal Bio </h2>



      <p> I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where my family lived for 2 years before we decided to live on a sailboat, which we did for 5 years. <br> After living in Puerto Rico, we moved to the United States and eventually settled in Florida. I came to Colorado to study at CU, and after graduation,<br> worked with carpentry and at StickerGiant in Longmont, before finally deciding to take a shot at Web Development, which has brought me here to Galvanize. </p>



      <p> Aside from my career related history, I am an avid musician. I have been playing guitar for about 10 years and have played in many bands. Death Metal is the genre I gravitated to the most, with a heavy focus on Technical and Progressive Death Metal. My last band was "Apotheon". Heres a link to for one of our <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATFxLFDcv5g" target = "_blank" > <strong>Music Videos</strong>. </a> </p>
      <p> I recently left Apotheon in order to allow more time to focus on studies. However, I am continuing to compose and record my own EP, which I hope to work on alongside my coding here at Galvanize. </p>

      <p> When I'm not learning how to code, or recording music, I spend my time relaxing with my dog, Bella, my girlfriend, and her two cats. <br> She enjoys reading while I play video games, some of my favoite games are: </p>

        <li> <strong>Fallout</strong> <p> Love em all, but I gotta go with <strong>New Vegas</strong> for the win.</p> </li>
        <li> <strong>Skyrim</strong> <p> Bethesda really knows how to make a good sandbox RPG.</p> </li>
