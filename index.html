      <dt>
  <p>
  My name is Andrew. I grew up in the town of Tallahassee,FL. While I had the typical "southern boy"
  upbringing surrounding hunting and sports, as I grew older I found myself detached from what everyone
  else was doing around me. In 2004, I moved to Winter Park, Colorado and started my 'great adventure'
  out West. After the 04/05 season I returned home and began to figure out what to do moving forward.
  I recieved a job offer with the United States Senate and was at a crossroads on what to do with the
  direction I was to take with my life. I chose to decline the job offer and return out West permanetly.
  Later would meet my fiance, Jennifer and with her start a family, household,
  and start her business, Studio 401.

<p>
Since I was a child I have always been enthralled with computers. In elementary school I would
often "forget to look at the time" and be in the library smashing out games on Apple IIe's or
checking out the internet in its infancy using the ancient Compuserve service. During my middle
school years I recieved my first computer from an uncle, and taught myself DOS and later Windows
3.1/95. I would
wake up at 5:30 to have chores done and be out the door in time to get to the computer lab
at 7:15 just to get get on the newly supplied Power Mac 5000/7000 series computers participating
in what was some of the first LAN gaming available. High school I was often in trouble for skipping
class to teach myself aspects of Photoshop, Flash, and HTML. Armed with Photoshop 5.0/5.5 when my school
didnt even own a copy and coming into class projects based off of
tutorials from at the time industry leads like: 2Advanced Studios, DesignsByMark, and phOng
the school was at a loss on what to do. My senior year I was no longer allowed
to enroll in any computer classes on campus due to technology directors opinion "I was wasting his
time and mine."</p>

<p>
Since my school years Ive worked with various platforms to deliver web content through
WordPress, CSS, content mangement systems (Joomla), and even 'cookie cutter' delivery methods such as
SquareSpace in addition to Google's platforms such as Analytics, AdWords, AdWordsExpress etc.
My computer enthasism also extends
the hardware side of things having built multiple desktops, preforming laptop modification,
and operation optimisation for graphics, rendering capability, and daily use.

    <dt>
        <p>Outside of computing, my passion lies in the realm of fitness and action sports. Skateboarding and
snowboarding were the first seeds planted. After ortopedic injury sidelined me for a season back in 2009,
I moved to BMX/Mountain Biking, and now that I have two young boys have started tying them
all together and adding Motocross into the mix.</p>
<p>
To keep my body holding somewhat together, I also keep in shape by utilizing functional fitness
practices. Utilizating tools such as weighted kettlebells, battleropes, pullup bars, and body weight
exercises keeps my fitness at a level to preform such taxing activities.</p>
