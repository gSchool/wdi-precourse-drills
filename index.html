        <h2>Some Information About Me:</h2>
      </center>
        <h3><p>My name is Nader Bayat and I am a 35 year old engineer. I came to the United States when I was 10 years old. I went to college in Northen California and I studied Chemical Engineering and Material Science. After Graduating, I worked in various Engineering roles in Texas, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and the Middle East. While I really enjoyed being an engineer, I wanted to try a new career path and that is why I am now learning about web development.

      </center>
        <ul>
          <li><p id="p02">Running</p></li>
              <p>I find running to be very relaxing. I am not a fast runner at all. However, I do enjoy running long distance and I have completed several marathons and half marathons in the past few years. My finish time is nothing to brag about....but hey, I managed to get across the finish line :)

          <li><p id="p02">Mountain Climbing</p></li>
              <p>I love hiking, trekking, and mountain climbing. Colorado is such a amazing place to be because of all the mountains and activities that can be done outdoors. Over the years, I have been able to climb several mountains. My favorite mountain was Cotopaxi in the country of Ecuador.

          <li><p id="p02">Traveling</p></li>
              <p>I love traveling and I have been fortunate to visit many great placed in the US and outside of the US. Since my previous job had a work rotation where I would work for 28 days and then have 28 days off, I was able to have a lot time for traveling.
