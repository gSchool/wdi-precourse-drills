Hello! Thank you for taking the time to click on this link, however much like Mario
the princess you seek is in another castle.

Here are the correct links to the movies and tv show that you just clicked on.
For Hackers: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
For 2000 AD: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214728/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3
For the Frontline Episode Hackers: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278472/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_42
For Hacker's Game: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3140724/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_12

Personally if your going to watch one I suggest Hackers because it is delightfully 90's and nostalgic.
