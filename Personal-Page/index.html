                         <p>Growing up in a deeply religious Southern Baptist household, with parents who had been together since middle school, made for quite the interesting childhood.  When I was 9 years old I found out that my mother had breast cancer, something she has been battling ever since.  To protect my sister, brother and I, our family simply did not discuss this.  Because of this avoidance, I did not truly come to terms with the severity of my mother’s illness until around fourth grade.
                         </p>
                          <p>
                          Years later, I finally came out to my parents when they found a book in my bedroom by Richard Dawkins, a prominent atheist, called ‘The Selfish Gene’.  Their first response was anger and disappointment in me for going against their religion.  They called me stupid because I didn't believe in the same things that they did.  Fortunately, they eventually came around to accept me the best that they could, and now support me in all that I do.</p>
                        <p>
                          During my undergraduate at the University of Louisville, I had the privilege of playing catcher for four years for the Louisville Cardinals, a top 10 nationally ranked baseball team.



Most recently, I founded a new venture called Tails, a pet sitting business here in the Mile High City.  Tails is made successful primarily because of great friends, and my client referral program.
