      <h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
      <p class="aLittleAboutMe"> I had spent a longtime figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. Since Graduating High School I have been to three different colleges, moved five times, had three jobs, one relationship, and many long nights. For most people, this is a nightmare.
        For me however, it has been the journey I was ment to take in order to get me where I'm going. </p>

      <h2>Why Programing?:</h2>
      <p class="whyPrograming">Programming, and specifically Galvanize, had been part of an internal conversation for much of that time spent moving and changing schools. I wanted to find a career that would allow me to make really good money while having the flexability to travel
        the world. I wanted to find something that I truly enjoy. I am so excited to open this chapter of my life and continue this crazy and beautiful journey.</p>

      <h2>Dreams:</h2>
      <p class="Dreams">Lately I have been trying to live in the present as much as possible. I have a tendency to strive for so many things at one time that my drive overheats much like a transmission without a 6th gear. All that aside, there is something to be said
        for being able to hold the vision and being able to plan in decades, think in years, work in months, and live in days. I hope to travel the world while building a future for myself and my family where money is no container for adventure, and love
        takes the reigns.</p>
