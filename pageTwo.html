  <p> I like programming because it's a nice balance between creativity and science. Engineering was all science with hardly any creativity.
Regarding the future, I don't know what it holds for me. Whether it's greatness, nothingness, or happiness
  I just have to wait and see. My goals are to have my own company or be involved in filmmaking somehow. I want to
  be a scientist as much as an artist, so I'm trying to find something that I fit with, which has yet to come. But I hope and feel
  being at Galvanize is a step in the right direction and I'm excited to get started.</p>
