<h1>Some info about me</h1>
<a name="bio"></a>
<h2>
	I've worked in IT and Operations for a while, but most of my experience is in untyped shell languages (that means everything is a string unless you go out of your way to specify otherwise). I'm a huge fan of Unix/Posix as a general rule. These definitions are getting a bit dated, but just about everything these days is gravitating towards something posix-alike, so it's a useful abstraction for non-desktop operation. I shamelessley borrowed the iphone jquery demo while looking for a good effect that wasn't, yet another snow falling effect. I've found the best way to go about learning *nix well, is to attempt to run your own mail server. It's a pain, but it'll touch on every facet of working with a *nix environment.
