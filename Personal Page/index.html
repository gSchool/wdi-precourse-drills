    <p>Hello!  My name is <strong>Justin</strong>.
      For the last 5 years or so I had been living in Fort Collins, CO and working as a Massage Therapist
      at a company called <a href="https://underpressuretherapeutics.com/">Under Pressure Theraputics</a>.
      The owner had actually hired me right out of school and was she is super awesome.  It
      was a lot of fun but now I'd like to expand my skill set and start a new career.<br><br></p><p>Having recently
      moved to Seattle I have very little idea on how to get around without a map or a guide.
      I moved into my sister and brother in-law's home (Sorry/Thanks, Michelle and Ron!).
