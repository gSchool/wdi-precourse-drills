    <h3 class="gifExplain">I am very excited for my new career!</h3>
    <p class="infoBlurb2">After finishing the program here at Galvanize I would
      like to take what I will have learned and join my friends in the Dev world.
      While Javascript is fantastic and two of my best friends have awesome careers
      with it I don't want to stop learning.  I do not know what kind of work I
      want to do but I know I will give it my all. </p>
