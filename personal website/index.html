      <p>Hi! Nice to meet you, I'm Melissa. I grew up in Memphis, TN and moved to Austin almost six years ago.</p>
      <p>I love almost everything about living in Austin, except the traffic (of course). I also do prefer the BBQ in Memphis over Austin, but I'm careful about who I tell that to because I've found it can lead to some heated debates.</p>
      <p>Feel free to click around and find out a little bit more about me!</p>

    <article id="hobbies-p">
      <p>There are a lot of things that I enjoy doing, but lately in my spare time I have been renovating my apartment. </p>
      <p>I recently just finished updating my fireplace and it was a little bit more involved than I thought it was going to be at the beginning, but it was definitely worth it.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy any outdoor activity (when it's not 100 degrees), reading, and of course, NetFlix.</p>

    <article id="pets-p">
      <p>Another one of my favorite things to do is hang out with my dog Jimmy. He is a schnauzer mix and loves to get dirty, especially after baths.</p>
      <p> He is not a big fan of the car, but he is getting better especially after his recent discovery of dog bones at the PTerry's drive thru window.</p>
