      <p>I went to school in Memphis (go Tigers) and have a BFA in graphic design.  In college, I was able to take a
      few basic coding classes and really enjoyed them. </p>
      <p>It's definitely been a while since I've taken those classes and things have changed a bit in the coding world.
        I have been enjoying getting my feet wet again and look forward to learning everything that I can.</p>

      <p>Afer college, it was challenging finding a job in my field, so after I moved to Austin I ended up falling into
      retail management.</p>
      <p>It was fun for a while, but it was not challenging, and after missing so many holidays with my family I decided
      it was time to start over.</p>
      <p>I am looking forward to beginning a new career after Galvanize that actually involves something that I enjoy and that
      will continue to challenge me.</p>
