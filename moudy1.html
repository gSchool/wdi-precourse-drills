<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<section>
<p>
   My short-term plan includes gaining the skill to build applications from
   the UX/UI design through the front and back ends. In the long-term, I plan to be invovled in a 
   startup business or other cutting edge application design and development. In 
   addition, I plan to use the skills gained to develop applications for my wife's Health and Fitness business.
