    <h1>My Goals</h1>
    <p>I'm excited, and also a bit nervous, about starting Galvanize. I chose
      Galvanize because my friends had such great experiences here, and I
      like Galvanize's class times and schedule. I believe I will be able to
      retain more information from Galvanize than I could at a bootcamp with
      12-13 hour days and, therefore, will get more out of this program. I'm
      not exactly sure yet what kind of company I'd like to work for, but I
      know I enjoy this kind of work. I also like that being a software
      developer can potentially allow me to travel more often, especially if
      I find a job where I can work remotely.</p>
      <h2>My background</h2>
      <p>My first experience with coding was when I was a teenager. I liked to
      play with virtual paper dolls called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisekae_Set_System" target="_blank">KiSS dolls</a>
      and eventually started making them myself. Part of this process involves
      coding your doll and all its clothes into the KiSS program. I found that
      I enjoyed the coding part of doll-making more than the drawing part. When
      the largest archive of dolls on the internet became a pay site I decided
      to teach myself HTML so I could build websites to host my dolls. My site
      background is a nod to that experience because I discovered KiSS dolls
      while trying to find Sailor Moon information online. You can see a
      screenshot of one of my old dolls <a href="clover.png">here</a>. I've been
      taking classes towards a Computer Science degree at ACC for the last two
      and a half years, but I got burned out. I still have the same career goals,
      and Galvanize seems like a much better way to achieve them.</p><br><br>
