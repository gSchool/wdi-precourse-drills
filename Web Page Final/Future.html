<h1 style="color: white;">The Future......</h1>

<h2></h2>

<p style="font-size: 24px;">
  To say that I'm excited to be accepted into the Galvanize program is an
  understatement.  I’ve reached a point in my career where I was not satisfied
  chasing a quota.  The carrot can never be reached and the stick is always
  present.  Coding was always an idea that seemed to be unrealistic.
  Another 4 years in school was not something that my family could sign up for.
    When I realized there could be another way - the clouds parted.  I love the
    solitude that comes from working on a solution.  In a small way - it’s
    peaceful.  When this is all over, the spot at the top of the mountain for
    me would be to work for a large corporation (again) but in a small group
    and supporting their projects.

  So how do I feel about getting into the Galvanize program?

  That sums it up nicely.
